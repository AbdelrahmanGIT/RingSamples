=======
Here i will post all the samples i create in my way of learning this language to help others understand and start learning of the `Ring` programming langugae.

so...
What is `Ring`?
========
as from http://ring-lang.net `Ring` is:
>The Ring is an Innovative and practical general-purpose multi-paradigm scripting language that can be embedded in C/C\++ projects, extended using C/C\++ code and/or used as standalone language.

>The supported programming paradigms are Imperative, Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional, Metaprogramming, Declarative programming using nested structures, and Natural programming. The language is portable (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, etc.) and can be used to create Console, GUI, Web, Games and Mobile applications.

>The language is designed to be Simple, Small, Flexiable and Fast. It's Dynamic Language (Dynamic Typing and Weakly Typed) that compile the source code to byte code then execute it by the Ring Virtual Machine, which is integrated with the Ring Compiler in one program. The first version of the language (around 100,000 lines of C/C++/Ring code) is released in January 25, 2016
